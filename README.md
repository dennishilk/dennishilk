## 👋 I’m Dennis — Linux nerd with too many penguins and too many projects  
🐧 Creator of Project Maxwell • Nebunix OS • Penguin Power Plant  
🛠 Building installers, fixes, configs and other questionable shell scripts  
💥 Arch • NixOS • Debian — yes, I daily-drive all of them

☕ Powered exclusively by East Frisian tea  
🔥 My scripts have 3 states: works, almost works, and why is everything on fire?
